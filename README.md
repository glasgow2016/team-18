# Maggie's Database & Speedy Input
This project consists of a database and a web frontend which provides quick input & viewing of its contents.

The database contains the following primary entities plus several secondary ones:
Centres, Staff Members, Activities, Known Visitors (for activity attendance purposes), Visitor Daily IDs, 3 instances of (anonymous) Visitors (PwC, Carer and Other) and Cancer Info.

Staff is expected to remember First Name and first daily contact time for Visitors in order to use this pair as a likely unique daily identifier in order to avoid double entries in the database.
